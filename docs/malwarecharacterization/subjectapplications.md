For completeness, we also attach the version of the code we extracted from these repositories, which we used in our analysis: 

- Hadoop: [zip](/assets/data/hadoop-source.zip) 
- ArchStudio: [zip](/assets/data/archstudio-source.zip) 
- Bash: [zip](/assets/data/bash-source.zip) 
- Mozilla Firefox: [zip](/assets/data/mozilla-source.zip) 
- XWiki: [zip](/assets/data/xwiki-source.zip) 


The weights of static and name-based similarity relationships we extracted in our study are given below:

- Hadoop: [zip](/assets/data/hadoop-weights.zip)
