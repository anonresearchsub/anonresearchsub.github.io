# Subject Applications

The repositories for the case study applications used in the paper can be found below:

- [Hadoop, 0.19.0](https://hadoop.apache.org/) (used in _Measuring the Impact of Code Dependencies on Software Architecture Recovery Techniques_ by Lutellier et al.)
- [ArchStudio, 4](https://github.com/isr-uci-edu/ArchStudio4) (used in _Measuring the Impact of Code Dependencies on Software Architecture Recovery Techniques_ by Lutellier et al.)
- [Bash, 4.2](https://github.com/bminor/bash/releases/tag/bash-4.2) (used in _Measuring the Impact of Code Dependencies on Software Architecture Recovery Techniques_ by Lutellier et al.)
- [Mozilla Firefox, 3.7a4](https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/firefox/releases/devpreview/1.9.3a4/) (used in _A fast clustering algorithm for modularization of large-scale software systems_ by Teymourian et al.)
- [XWiki, 14.1](https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform) 


For completeness, we also attach the version of the code we extracted from these repositories, which we used in our analysis: 

- Hadoop: [zip](/assets/data/hadoop-source.zip) 
- ArchStudio: [zip]() 
- Bash: [zip](/assets/data/bash-source.zip) 
- Mozilla Firefox: [zip](/assets/data/mozilla-source.zip) 
- XWiki: [zip]() 


The weights of static and name-based similarity relationships we extracted in our study are given below:

- Hadoop: [zip]() 
- ArchStudio: [zip]() 
- Bash: [zip]() 
- Mozilla Firefox: [zip]() 
- XWiki: [zip]()
